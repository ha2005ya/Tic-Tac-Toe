# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.

One player uses X, the other uses O.

Players take turns putting their mark in an empty square.

The goal is to get three in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If all squares are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.

It’s quick, easy, and fun — but also about smart moves and strategy
